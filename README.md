## What Are Roblox Codes?

Roblox codes are a type of promotional offer given out by the Roblox team or game developers. These codes can provide various rewards such as in-game currency (Robux), exclusive items, skins, or boosts in specific games. They are usually short sequences of letters and numbers and can be redeemed within the Roblox platform.

### How Roblox Codes Work

Roblox codes are designed to give players a chance to unlock exclusive items or rewards. They work in different ways depending on the type of code. Some are for specific games, while others are universal codes that can be redeemed across the entire Roblox platform.

When a code is released, it typically comes with an expiration date, meaning it can only be used during a certain time period. Codes may be issued through special events, updates, or collaborations with brands, creators, or influencers.

## How to Redeem Roblox Codes?

3. **Go to the Promo Code Redemption Page**  
   - On the Roblox website, go to the “Redeem Codes” page, which you can find by searching for “Redeem Codes” in the search bar or in the settings.
